# Poker-Game-Project-Euler-54-

This is a C++ based solution for problem 54 on projecteuler.com

At this point I have been programming for only 2 months, so I'm sure my code is far less than spectacular. 

Also, I used "namespace std" simply to make the code more ledgible. I am aware that it is a "no-no" and I've never used it apart from this project.
